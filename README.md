# Least Squares Solver Using LAPACK's DGELS Routine

This project implements a command-line tool to solve the least-squares problem. Given an over-determined system of linear equations (more equations than unknowns), the least-squares method finds the best-fitting solution by minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals (the differences between the observed and computed values). This tool leverages the LAPACK library's DGELS routine to efficiently compute the least-squares solution.
